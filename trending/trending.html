            <h3>Vinland Saga (2019)</h3>
            <img
              src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Vinland-Saga-Thorfinn-holding-dagger-Cropped-Cropped.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
              alt="one"
            />
            <p>
              Set in the Viking Age, Vinland Saga follows the transformative
              story of Thorfinn, a young warrior who is initially full of hatred
              and wanting revenge against his father’s killer. Over time, his
              arc changes as he learns to become a pacifist. <br />
              At the same time as the protagonist’s journey, a dangerous power
              grows in the form of King Canute, whose villainous ways soon
              affect Thorfinn’s path. <br />

              Vinland Saga’s exploration of the historical period is unique in
              anime. This setting results in original and rich characterization,
              fascinating Viking lore, and, of course, fantastic battles and
              action sequences.
              <br />
              That said, this period isn’t for everyone, and new anime fans may
              want to dive into something less specific in terms of historicity
              for their first series.

            <h3>Shaman King (2001 - 2005)</h3>
            <img
              src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/characters-from-shaman-king.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
              alt="two"
            />
            <p>
              Shaman King follows the misadventures of Yoh Asakura, a laid-back
              and carefree young boy who possesses the ability to communicate
              with spirits. Yoh later decides to take on a challenging task – to
              become the next Shaman King. <br />
              In order to do this, he must train and go on a perilous journey to
              compete in the Shaman Fight and prove himself to be the best.
              <br />
              <br />
              Yoh’s growth as a powerful shaman and an endearing character is
              the focus of the series, which blends mysticism with a healthy
              dose of action. <br />
              For those new to anime or seeking an exhilarating blend of
              supernatural powers and personal growth, Shaman King is
              predictable for seasoned anime fans, but likely to be exciting for
              newcomers.

            <h3>Code Geass (2006 - 2008)</h3>
            <img

              alt="tree"
            />
            <p>
              Introducing fan-favorite characters from the 2000s, Code Geass is
              set in a world where the black prince Lelouch strives to create a
              new reality using the power of the Glass. Despite the oppressive
              Holy Britannian Empire’s destructive weapons helping maintain
              control, he still dares to go against the tyrannical leadership.
              <br />
              <br />
              Full of political intrigue and mechanics battles, Code Geass is an
              adrenaline-pumping series.
              <br />
              It depicts Lelouch's dual identity as a brilliant student and a
              masked rebel leader called Zero, as well as his morally ambiguous
              decisions that can challenge viewers’ perspectives. <br />
              It’s not clear-cut or black-and-white, which some audiences may
              not appreciate.

            <h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion(1995 - 1996)</h3>
            <img
              src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/neon_genesis_evangelion-social.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
              alt="four"
            />
            <p>
              Neon Genesis Evangelion is a legendary anime show that takes place
              in a world ruined by the cataclysmic Second Impact. <br />
              Zooming in on Tokyo-3, it depicts Shinji Ikari’s journey after
              he’s recruited to an organization that uses mechanics called
              Evangelion – his objective is to fight beings called Angels.
              <br />The show follows these pilots as they battle more and more
              Angels to prevent another cataclysm. <br /><br />
              Known as a deconstruction of the mecha subgenre, Neon Genesis
              Evangelion has an unconventional narrative and also blends surreal
              dream sequences with philosophical monologues to deliver
              hard-hitting quotations about existence and power. <br />
              It’s a gorgeous and complex story that has achieved wide renown,
              but it may also be too heavy and vague for those who are new to
              anime, especially its controversial convoluted ending (which had
              to be re-explained in a series of films).

            <h3>Yuri!!! On Ice(2016)</h3>
            <img
              src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Yuri-On-Ice.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
              alt="five"
            />
            <p>
              Arguably the sports anime to watch if newcomers had to pick just
              one, Yuri!!! On Ice is a delightful show centered on the
              competitive world of figure skating. There, Japanese figure skater
              Yuuri Katsuki, who is struggling to find his confidence after a
              series of defeats teams up with Russian skater Viktor Nikiforov,
              who coaches him in preparation for an upcoming Grand Prix.
              <br /><br />
              Aside from showcasing the dazzling world of competitive figure
              skating, Yuri!!! On Ice captures fans’ attention with its
              portrayal of the evolving and often heartwarming bond between
              Yuuri and Viktor. <br />
              A seamless combination of figure skating and romance, it’s a great
              choice for those already interested in the sport to begin with.
