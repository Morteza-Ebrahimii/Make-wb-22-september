        Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from
        Japan. <br />
        Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation
        produced in Japan. <br />
        However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a
        shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works,
        regardless of style or origin. <br />
        Animation produced outside Japan with a similar style to Japanese
        animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation.
        <br /><br />
        The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A
        characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of
        cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a
        large domestic audience. <br />
        Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts,
        directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original
        works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light
        novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting
        various broad and niche audiences. <br /><br />
        Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have
        adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art,
        characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
        individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime
        production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of
        settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and
        angle shots. Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and
        features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being
        large and emotive eyes.

        In the 1960s, manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and
        simplified Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and limit frame
        counts in his productions. Originally intended as temporary measures to
        allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with an inexperienced
        staff, many of his limited animation practices came to define the
        medium's style. <br />
        <br />Three Tales (1960) was the first anime film broadcast on
        television; the first anime television series was Instant History
        (1961–64). An early and influential success was Astro Boy (1963–66), a
        television series directed by Tezuka based on his manga of the same
        name. <br />
        Many animators at Tezuka's Mushi Production later established major
        anime studios (including Madhouse, Sunrise, and Pierrot).
