                    <h3>Vinland Saga (2019)</h3>
                    <img src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Vinland-Saga-Thorfinn-holding-dagger-Cropped-Cropped.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
                        alt="one">
                    <p>Set in the Viking Age, Vinland Saga follows the transformative story of Thorfinn, a young warrior
                        who is initially full of hatred and wanting revenge against his father’s killer. Over time, his
                        arc changes as he learns to become a pacifist. <br> At the same time as the protagonist’s
                        journey, a dangerous power grows in the form of King Canute, whose villainous ways soon affect
                        Thorfinn’s path. <br>

                        Vinland Saga’s exploration of the historical period is unique in anime. This setting results in
                        original and rich characterization, fascinating Viking lore, and, of course, fantastic battles
                        and action sequences.
                        <br> That said, this period isn’t for everyone, and new anime fans may want to dive into
                        something less specific in terms of historicity for their first series.

                    <h3>Shaman King (2001 - 2005)</h3>
                    <img src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/characters-from-shaman-king.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
                        alt="two">
                    <p>Shaman King follows the misadventures of Yoh Asakura, a laid-back and carefree young boy who
                        possesses the ability to communicate with spirits. Yoh later decides to take on a challenging
                        task – to become the next Shaman King. <br> In order to do this, he must train and go on a
                        perilous journey to compete in the Shaman Fight and prove himself to be the best. <br>
                        <br>
                        Yoh’s growth as a powerful shaman and an endearing character is the focus of the series, which
                        blends mysticism with a healthy dose of action. <br> For those new to anime or seeking an
                        exhilarating blend of supernatural powers and personal growth, Shaman King is predictable for
                        seasoned anime fans, but likely to be exciting for newcomers.

                    <h3>Code Geass (2006 - 2008)</h3>
                    <img src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/two-men-from-code-geass.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
                        alt="tree">
                    <p>Introducing fan-favorite characters from the 2000s, Code Geass is set in a world where the black
                        prince Lelouch strives to create a new reality using the power of the Glass. Despite the
                        oppressive Holy Britannian Empire’s destructive weapons helping maintain control, he still dares
                        to go against the tyrannical leadership. <br>
                        <br>
                        Full of political intrigue and mechanics battles, Code Geass is an adrenaline-pumping series.
                        <br> It depicts Lelouch's dual identity as a brilliant student and a masked rebel leader called
                        Zero, as well as his morally ambiguous decisions that can challenge viewers’ perspectives. <br>
                        It’s not clear-cut or black-and-white, which some audiences may not appreciate.

                    <h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion(1995 - 1996)</h3>
                    <img src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/neon_genesis_evangelion-social.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1500&dpr=1.5"
                        alt="four">
                    <p>Neon Genesis Evangelion is a legendary anime show that takes place in a world ruined by the
                        cataclysmic Second Impact. <br> Zooming in on Tokyo-3, it depicts Shinji Ikari’s journey after
                        he’s recruited to an organization that uses mechanics called Evangelion – his objective is to
                        fight beings called Angels. <br>The show follows these pilots as they battle more and more
                        Angels to prevent another cataclysm.
                        <br><br>
                        Known as a deconstruction of the mecha subgenre, Neon Genesis Evangelion has an unconventional
                        narrative and also blends surreal dream sequences with philosophical monologues to deliver
                        hard-hitting quotations about existence and power. <br> It’s a gorgeous and complex story that
                        has achieved wide renown, but it may also be too heavy and vague for those who are new to anime,
                        especially its controversial convoluted ending (which had to be re-explained in a series of
                        films).

                    <h3>Yuri!!! On Ice(2016)</h3>

                        alt="five">
                    <p>Arguably the sports anime to watch if newcomers had to pick just one, Yuri!!! On Ice is a
                        delightful show centered on the competitive world of figure skating. There, Japanese figure
                        skater Yuuri Katsuki, who is struggling to find his confidence after a series of defeats teams
                        up with Russian skater Viktor Nikiforov, who coaches him in preparation for an upcoming Grand
                        Prix.
                        <br><br>
                        Aside from showcasing the dazzling world of competitive figure skating, Yuri!!! On Ice captures
                        fans’ attention with its portrayal of the evolving and often heartwarming bond between Yuuri and
                        Viktor. <br> A seamless combination of figure skating and romance, it’s a great choice for those
                        already interested in the sport to begin with.
